Bouncing ball is an application that utilizes JavaScript and HTML5 to show animation and collision detection.  The HTML5 canvas API was used for drawing the ball and the rectangle.  JavaScript was used for creating the programming logic to show animation and collision detection.  A form is also available where the end user can change the horizontal and vertical velocity of the ball.  HTML5 form validation was done by specifying input type to be a "number" and a min and max value was also specified for the velocities.
